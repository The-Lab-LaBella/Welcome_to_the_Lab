# Welcome_to_the_Lab

Welcome to the Lab LaBella! We are so happy you are here.

This will serve as a quick-start guide to the lab with links to more in depth descriptions

## General Lab Expectations

You are expected to treat everyone with **respect**. This includes respecting their science, ideas, and all aspects of their identity.

A detailed list of expectations can be found here: <https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/LaBellaLabHandbook>

## Lab Communication

**Slack** - We use slack for day-to-day communication. If you have not been invited to the slack channel email Dr. LaBella

**Email** - Use email for any formal requests or important information. Remember, everything you write in an email can be used in a court of law!

**Calendar** - There is a lab calendar that is used to keep track of standing meetings

**Trello** - We are currently piloting using Trello to track project progress.

## Lab Spaces

**Bioinformatics Building** - Dr. LaBella's office is BINF 428. There are two options for working in the Bioinformatics Building. You can work in the LaBella lab computational room BINF 422. Master's students also have access to desks on the 3rd floor. Please email Dr. LaBella about options for working in the building. 

If you need access to the Bioinformatics Building after hours you will need to fill out a building request form. Email Dr. LaBella for that form.

**NCRC** - Dr. LaBella's wet lab and main office is at the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory (150 N Research Campus Dr. Kannapolis NC 28081).

**You will need an ID card to access the building.** Please work with Dr. LaBella on obtaining an ID card.

There are plenty of student spaces at the NCRC. Work with Dr. LaBella to find a cubicle. You will have a monitor, mouse, and keyboard at your space in the NCRC

Access to the wet-lab is restricted to individuals who have BSLII certification. If you will be working in the wet-lab we will work on getting that set up.

## High Performance Computing Cluster

You will need access to the HPC here at UNC Charlotte. If you had access in a class this will not be sufficient for our work. You will need to **request a research account** by going to this link https://services.help.charlotte.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=140

Make sure you **also ask for access to /projects/labella_lab**

The HPC has some help pages but I've put together a quick-start HPC guide here: https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Welcome_to_the_Lab/blob/51e711fc28308f657b9648db7fc7e7ff8d9fc557/HPC_getting_started.md#submitting-jobs-to-the-cluster 

## Mentorship Compact

Each member of the lab has different goals and research interests. To make sure that I'm providing appropriate guides, each semester we will work together to create a Mentorship Compact that outlines research and goals for both Dr. LaBella and you.

We will sit down and go over this once a semester and update it. If you want to check it out you can find it here: TBD
