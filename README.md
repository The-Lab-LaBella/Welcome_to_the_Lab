## General Lab Expectations {#general-lab-expectations}

You are expected to treat everyone with **respect**. This includes respecting their science, ideas, and all aspects of their identity.

A detailed list of expectations can be found here: <https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/LaBellaLabHandbook>

## Lab Communication {#lab-communication}

**Slack** - We use slack for day-to-day communication. If you have not been invited to the slack channel email Dr. LaBella

**Email** - Use email for any formal requests or important information. Remember, everything you write in an email can be used in a court of law!

**Calendar** - There is a lab calendar that is used to keep track of standing meetings

**Trello** - We are currently piloting using Trello to track project progress.

## Lab Spaces

**Bioinformatics Building** - There is no dedicated LaBella Lab space in the bioinformatics building. Dr. LaBella's office is BINF 327. If you need a work-space in the Bioinformatics building please email Dr. LaBella and she will find you a space in the shared graduate offices.

**NCRC** - Dr. LaBella's wet lab and main office is at the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory (150 N Research Campus Dr. Kannapolis NC 28081).

**You will need an ID card to access the building.** Please work with Dr. LaBella on obtaining an ID card.

There are plenty of student spaces at the NCRC. Work with Dr. LaBella to find a cubicle. You will have a monitor, mouse, and keyboard at your space in the NCRC

Access to the wet-lab is restricted to individuals who have BSLII certification. If you will be working in the wet-lab we will work on getting that set up.
